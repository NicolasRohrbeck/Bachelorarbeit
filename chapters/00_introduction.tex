\addchap{Introduction \label{ch:introduction}}
In this thesis the use of a combination of a magnetometer and accelerometer as a means of attitude determination during unmanned balloon flights is presented. The used components allow for an extremely light and small design. The objective of this thesis was the interpretation of acquired data during flight to implement the \ac{ADS}.
