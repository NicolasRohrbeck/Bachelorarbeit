\addchap{Introduction \label{ch:introduction}}
The \acf{REXUS/BEXUS} programme is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the \acf{DLR} and the \acf{SNSA}. The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the \acf{ESA}. EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the \acf{SSC} and the \acf{MORABA} of \acs{DLR}, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from \acs{DLR}, \acs{SSC}, \acs{ZARM} and \acs{ESA} provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. \acs{REXUS} and \acs{BEXUS} are launched from \acs{SSC}, \acs{ESRANGE} Space Center in northern Sweden.

The first balloon of the \acs{REXUS/BEXUS} programme, \textit{BEXUS 1}, launched on November 25$^{\mathrm{th}}$ 2002 at 15:53 UTC. Every year after this, barred for 2003, 2020 and 2022, saw balloons being launched from the designated launch site \ac{ESRANGE} near the Swedish city of Kiruna \parencite{IAC-08.E.1.1.4}\parencite{bexus-campaign-history}.
The \ac{REXUS/BEXUS} programme offers university student teams the opportunity to build an experiment and have it fly on a stratospheric balloon. The programme spans around one year and is constructed as a scaled-down version of a real space mission. \ac{SETH} takes part in the 16th \ac{BEXUS} cycle and is expected to fly between the 3$^\mathrm{rd}$ of October 2025 and the 13$^\mathrm{th}$ of October 2025 from \ac{ESRANGE}.

This thesis covers a sub-system of \ac{SETH} with the purpose of measuring two vectors: the magnetic field of the earth and the gravitational acceleration. At first we give necessary background information about the \ac{SETH} experiment as a part of the \ac{REXUS/BEXUS} programme (sec.~\ref{sec:bg:seth_and_bx_programme}) and explain the working principles of the magnetometer (sec.~\ref{sec:bg:magnetometers} and accelerometer used (sec.~\ref{sec:bg:accelerometers}) and the possible sources of systematic measurement error (sec.~\ref{sec:bg:measurement_errors}).\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:methodology} presents the foundations of what is done during data acquisition (sec.~\ref{sec:meth:data_acquisition}), the program used to calculate and plot the results (sec.~\ref{sec:meth:data_interpretation}), an extensive overview of how the sensors are calibrated (sec.~\ref{sec:meth:calibration_technique}), how pitch, roll and heading are calculated (sec.~\ref{sec:meth:determination_heading}) and some reflection on the previous steps after the calibration is done (sec.~\ref{sec:meth:reflection_methodology}).\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:data} presents the data which was used for calibration (sec~\ref{sec:da:vector_fields}) and how the calibration measurement was done (sec.~\ref{sec:da:calibration_meas}).\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:calibration_results} presents the results of the calibration measurement and how the optimal coefficients were acquired.\\
In Chapter~\ref{ch:flight_data} the optimal coefficients are used to calibrate the data set acquired during flight and an analysis is done on pitch, roll and heading around launch (sec.~\ref{sec:launch}), during ascent (sec.~\ref{sec:ascent}), around balloon burst (sec.~\ref{sec:balloon_burst}) and during descent (sec.~\ref{sec:descent}).\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion_outlook} gives a summary of the work and will touch on its relevanc to the \ac{SETH} experiment.
